Project: Garage Sale and Item Listing

Users are able to create an account. It's allowed only one account by email.
After creating an account users can login and see the Garage Sale and the 
Item Listing pages.

Garage Sales are listed by entering Title, Description, Address, Date and 
Hours.
Items are listed by entering Name, Details, Price, Category and Pictures.

Users can create Garage Sales and Item listings.


Features that do not work:
Garage Sale and Item listing pages are not protected against "guest users".
Ideal would be that those pages would be visible only after a successful login.
When we try to create a garage or item listing without being logged in a error 
occurs.
